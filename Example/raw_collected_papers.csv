However, their hydrophobicity and poor dispersibility in water restrict their applications in aqueous environments. Herein, the dispersibility of MWCNTs was significantly enhanced with a chimeric protein MPKE which consisted of a zwitterionic peptide unit and a mussel adhesive protein unit. The MPKE could be easily attached to MWCNTs (MPKE-MWCNTs) by a simple stirring process due to the versatile adhesion ability of mussel adhesive unit. As expected, the MPKE-MWCNTs displayed outstanding dispersibility in water (>7 months), as well as in alkaline solutions (pH = 12) and organic solvents (DMSO and ethanol) due to the hydrophilicity of the zwitterionic peptide unit. Moreover, the MPKE-MWCNTs were used as silver nanoparticle carriers for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol in wastewater, with the normalized rate constant knor up to 32.9 s−1 mmol−1. Meanwhile, they also exhibited excellent biocompatibility and antibacterial activity, which were favorable for wastewater treatment. This work provides a facile strategy for MWCNT modification, functionalization and applications in aqueous environments."

All rights reserved.In this work, ultrafine powders of β-FeOOH and Fe3O4(specific surface area values are 101 and 135 m2/g, respectively) have been obtained by precipitation method. Frequency dependences of electrical conductivity was analyzed in the temperature range of 20 - 150 °C. It has been found that the both materials show a superlinear behavior of the frequency dependent electrical conductivity. The values of activation energies for direct current conductivity, cross-over frequency for the electrical conductivity described by Jonscher power law and the superlinear law are 0.55, 0.51 and 0.16 eV for β-FeOOH and 0.22, 0.21 and 0.1 eV for Fe3O4, respectively. According to cyclic voltammetry (scan rate in the range of 1-50 mV/s) β-FeOOH material shows a specific capacitance up to 80 F/g, while the one for the Fe3O4material is about 32 F/g. Galvanostatic cycling measurements have been done for discharge currents of 0.05 - 0.25 A/g. The specific energy and power of about 8 W h/kg and 20 W/kg were achieved for the β-FeOOH material when Fe3O4material demonstrate the specific power only up to 3.5 W/kg."

Water hyacinth is one of the major problems that is facing humankind and especially here in Egypt. One of the implications of industrial activities is environmental pollution. Dyes used in the production of textiles, paper, and clothes are one of the major pollutants. The waste of those dyes discharged into water supplies without treatment or with ineffective treatment harmfully impacts the environment. In this research, the treatment is implemented using active carbon-based catalysts using embedded nanoparticles. This leads to a huge increase in the adsorbent's surface area, also increasing the adsorbent efficiency. The activated carbon was derived from water hyacinth that grows near the Nile River. Water hyacinth has many practical uses as it can absorb heavy metals like lead and dyes. Water hyacinth was converted into activated carbon through carbonization. Different dyes were used with different contact times in fixed conditions."

Nowadays, the common material used as a cathode electrocatalyst on metal-Air battery is platinum because of its superior properties. However, the scarcity and the expensive price cause platinum no longer to be the right choice, in hence we need to develop an alternative material for cathode electrocatalyst. The transition metal oxide is considered due to its high abundance, low cost, and environmentally friendly. Magnetite-Fe3O4 has great potential to be developed as electrocatalyst because of its excellent catalytic properties. However, other materials are needed to support electrical conductivity and porosity. Therefore, in this study, Fe3O4/graphene-like nanomaterial was synthesized as an electrocatalyst of metal-Air battery cathode. In this research, magnetite-Fe3O4 synthesis with electrochemically method using multielectrode from solid waste iron plate, whereas graphene-like nanomaterial had synthesized from coconut shell charcoal with a series process of calcination-Hummer method modification-chemical reduction treatments. Magnetite-Fe3O4/graphene-like nanocomposites were fabricated using powder ball mill method and compacted as dense material. This approach offers pure magnetite phase from solid waste iron. The reaction pathways leading to this new morphology and structure have been discussed. Magnetite-Fe3O4/graphene-like composite had specific surface area between 393-542m2/g with pore size of 5.1-6.8nm which is classified as mesoporous material. It observed that Fe3O4 distributed on the graphene-like surface to formed particulate composite. Fe3O4/graphene-like composite shown good ability as electrocatalytic and showed oxygen reduction capability."

Various characterization results proved that nano-size Co3O4 was loaded on MXene nanosheets and CMNs exhibited a large specific surface area, especially for CMNs-3 (76.9 m2·g−1). The catalytic properties of CMNs for ammonium perchlorate (AP) thermal decomposition were investigated by a series of catalytic experiments. The results showed that the high-temperature decomposition (HTD) temperature and decomposition heat of AP mixed with CMNs-3 (2 wt%) could significantly decrease to 316.3 °C and remarkably increase to 1457.9 J·g−1, respectively. Moreover, the CMNs-3 could significantly reduce the apparent activation energy of AP by 49.1% and increase the value of reaction rate constant of AP by 482.0%. As for the effects of mass content of CMNs-3 on AP decomposition, the HTD temperature could decrease by as high as 128.0 °C with ratios of 10.0 wt% CMNs-3. It could be predicted that CMNs-3 with excellent catalytic performance would be a potential catalyst to promote AP decomposition and the synthesis method of CMNs-3 could provide an idea for the preparation of other metal oxide nanomaterials with high catalytic activity."

It is a critical challenge to understand the interactions between the single-atom metal active sites and the support materials. Recently, original research reports of SACs in biomedical applications have emerged in the literature, yet this topic has seldom been reviewed. Here, this review focuses on the latest advances in single-atom catalysis for biomedical applications and highlights the keys for the design of SACs, such as understanding the interactions between metals and supports and classifying various enzyme-like activities. This review helps bridge the knowledge of multiple disciplines and provides prospects regarding the development of SACs for biomedicine."

The LSMC-Ru exhibits outstanding bifunctional activity with a low potential gap of 0.72 V between the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potential at 10 mA cm-2 and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) half-wave potential. The strong electronic interaction between RuOx and LSMC is confirmed by both experiments and theoretical calculations. Consequently, the electron-rich Mn centers promote ORR, while the electron-deficient Ru centers facilitate OER. A Zn-air battery using the LSMC-Ru air electrode delivers a peak power density of 159 mW cm-2 and a low charge-discharge potential gap of 0.58 V at 2 mA cm-2. The high round-trip energy efficiency of 60.6% is retained after 300 cycles. This strategy of anchoring a low dosage noble metal catalyst to perovskite can be extended to other systems of noble metal-non-noble metal composite electrocatalysts to achieve both competitive performance and low cost."

TiO2, as a semiconductor material, is commonly not established as an active electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution due to its poor electrical conductivity and low reactivity. Here, we demonstrated that composites composed of TiO2 and N-doped graphene can be active in oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in an alkaline environment. Combination factors such anatase/rutile interaction, N-doping graphene, and the presence of Ti3+/Ti–N species raise the active sites and improve the electrochemical activity. Our results may afford an opportunity to develop a non-noble and promising electrocatalyst in energy storage technology."

Published by American Chemical SocietyA nitrogen-containing covalent organic framework obtained from the polymerization of 1,3-dicyanobenzene has been used as a starting material for the synthesis of Fe/N/C catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this work we report the effect of the thermal treatments on the nature and catalytic properties of the catalysts obtained after the thermal treatments. After the first thermal treatment, the catalysts obtained contain metallic iron and iron carbide particles, along with a minority fraction of inorganic FeNx sites. After acid leaching and a second thermal treatment, FeNx sites remain in the catalysts, along with a minor fraction of graphite-wrapped Fe3C particles. Both catalysts display high activity for the ORR, with the catalyst subjected to acid leaching and a second thermal treatment, 2HT-1,3DCB, displaying higher ORR activity and a lower production of H2O2. This observation suggests that iron particles, such as Fe3C, display ORR activity but mainly toward the two-electron pathway. On the contrary, FeNx ensembles promote the ORR via the four-electron pathway, that is, via H2O formation."

It enables the production of clean fuels and chemical products, and it ultimately allows the mitigation of undesired gas or liquid emissions to the environment. These features are highly recognized by the scientific community, industrial sector, and society. Despite this relevance, the hurdles that must be overcome to become industrially relevant are less known. There are many demanding requirements. This commentary reviews, from an academic point of view, the implementation requirements of a catalytic material. The motivation for this perspective article comes from the existing gap between academic research and industrial application. This account first defines what a catalytic material is, from the structural and application point of views. It then locates the catalytic material in an entire system analysis. This includes active sites, reactor system, the entire plant and the integration with other processes. Subsequently, the properties of an ideal industrial catalyst are described, such as activity, selectivity, volumetric efficiency, compatibility, stability, and economics. Finally, it discusses challenges related to the next stages in the process development. These may limit the application, although the material is attractive at the fundamental scale. The discussed topics provide an overview of the fascinating world of catalytic materials and their challenges. The expectation is that more catalysis-based concepts will contribute in the future to more sustainable technologies."

Published by American Chemical Society.Finding an effective strategy to promote the charge transfer and separation of TiO2 is urgently needed. Herein, a surface fluorination (F-)-modified TiO2 (denoted as TO-xF, where x represents the volume of HF added in the solution) catalyst has been prepared by a mild and facile post-treatment method. The changes induced by surface F- on the morphological, structural, and surface electronic features and the charge separation and transfer efficiency of TiO2 were specifically examined. Compared with pristine TO, TO-0.4F exhibits enhanced photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange and phenol, production of hydroxyl radicals, and photocurrent response. The enhanced photocatalytic activities of TO-0.4F can be attributed to the role of surface F- as surface trapping sites in effectively boosting the charge transfer and separation processes, which is verified by the steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, Bode plot, transient photocurrent response, and open-circuit voltage measurements. This study emphasizes the role of surface F- in promoting the charge transfer and separation and improving the photocatalytic activity of TiO2."

The electrochemical properties of Zn–Al–La-LDHs as negative electrode materials for Zn–Ni batteries were studied by the cyclic voltammetry, Tafel polarization curve, and constant current charge–discharge test. XRD and SEM analysis showed that the crystallinity of the prepared Zn–Al–La-LDHs was good and the dispersion was uniform and showed regular hexagonal structures. The results of electrical properties show that Zn–Al–La-LDHs have good cycle reversibility and corrosion resistance when applied to Zn–Ni secondary batteries.

In interpreting experimental kinetic data, few studies have explicitly accounted for the impact of H* coverage and mass transport, which lead to discrepancies in the kinetic parameters and the resultant reaction mechanism. Here, we present how to determine the kinetic parameters accounting for both effects. We discuss the use of the kinetic parameters towards mechanistic interpretations for HOR/HER and show that, in general, knowledge of the coverage of H* or activation energies may be required to assign a reaction mechanism. We apply these ideas to activity data of several HOR and HER electrocatalysts, such as Au, Pt, MoS2, and CoP."

Single-metal-atom and nitrogen co-doped carbonaceous electrocatalysts (M-N-C) have emerged as attractive alternatives to noble-metal platinum for catalyzing the kinetically sluggish ORR due to their high electrical conductivity, large surface area, and structural tunability at the atomic level, however, their application is limited by the low intrinsic activity of the metal-nitrogen coordination sites (M-Nx) and inferior site density. In this Perspective, we summarize the recent progress and milestones relating to the active site engineering of single atom carbonous electrocatalysts for enhancing the ORR activity. Particular emphasis is placed on the emerging strategies for regulating the electronic structure of the single metal site and populating the site density. In addition, challenges and perspectives are provided regarding the future development of single atom carbonous electrocatalysts for the ORR and their utilization in practical use."

A prerequisite for the practical application of various electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies is the development of efficient and robust electrocatalysts. Recently, molecularly designed heterogeneous catalysts have drawn great attention because they combine the advantages of both heterogeneous solid and homogeneous molecular catalysts. In particular, recently emerged metal-phenolic networks (MPNs) show promise as electrocatalysts for various electrochemical reactions owing to their unique features. They can be easily synthesized under mild conditions, making them eco-friendly, form uniform and conformal thin films on various kinds of substrates, accommodate various metal ions in a single-atom manner, and have excellent charge-transfer ability. In this minireview, we summarize the development of various MPN-based electrocatalysts for diverse electrochemical reactions, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction, the CO2 reduction reaction, and the N2 reduction reaction.

A crosstalk between electrochemical and multi-physical characterization techniques,2021,2,2023-05-01 10:45:44,"© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.Molecular catalysts show powerful catalytic efficiency and unsurpassed selectivity in many reactions of interest. As their implementation in electrocatalytic devices requires their immobilization onto a conductive support, controlling the grafting chemistry and its impact on their distribution at the surface of this support within the catalytic layer is key to enhancing and stabilizing the current they produce. This study focuses on molecular bioinspired nickel catalysts for hydrogen oxidation, bound to carbon nanotubes, a conductive support with high specific area. We couple advanced analysis by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), for direct imaging of the catalyst layer on individual nanotubes, and small angle neutron scattering (SANS), for indirect observation of structural features in a relevant aqueous medium. Low-dose TEM imaging shows a homogeneous, mobile coverage of catalysts, likely as a monolayer coating the nanotubes, while SANS unveils a regular nanostructure in the catalyst distribution on the surface with agglomerates that could be imaged by TEM upon aging. Together, electrochemistry, TEM and SANS analyses allowed drawing an unprecedented and intriguing picture with molecular catalysts evenly distributed at the nanoscale in two different populations required for optimal catalytic performance."

Spontaneous adsorption of aryl functional groups was observed, with surface coverages ranging from 20 to 96% depending on the native reactivity of the salt as determined by the aryl substitution pattern. Increased coverage was possible for low reactivity species using a sacrificial reductant. Functionalization was confirmed using thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The structure and energetics of this nanocrystal electrocatalyst system, as a function of ligand coverage, were explored with density functional theory calculations. The Hammett parameter of the surface functional group was found to linearly correlate with the change in Ni and P core–electron binding energies and the nanocrystal’s experimentally and computationally determined work function. The electrocatalytic activity and stability of the functionalized nanocrystals for hydrogen evolution were also improved when compared to the unfunctionalized material, but a simple trend based on electrostatics was not evident. Density functional theory was used to understand this discrepancy, revealing that H adsorption energies on the covalently functionalized Ni2P also do not follow the electrostatic trend and are predictive descriptors of the experimental results."

Besides the experimental insights, a theoretical investigation that simulates reaction conditions-so-called operando modeling-is necessary for a plausible understanding of a working catalyst system at the atomic scale. However, there is still a huge gap between the current widely used computational model and the concept of operando modeling, which should be achieved through multiscale computational modeling. This Perspective describes various modeling approaches and machine learning techniques that step toward operando modeling, followed by selected experimental examples that present an operando understanding in the thermo- and electrocatalytic processes.

All rights reserved.Restructuring is an important yet less understood phenomenon in the catalysis community. Recent studies have shown that a group of transition metal sulfide catalysts can completely or partially restructure during electrochemical reactions which then exhibit high activity even better than the best commercial standards. However, such restructuring processes and the final structures of the new catalysts are elusive, mainly due to the difficulty from the reaction-induced changes that cannot be captured by ex situ characterizations. To establish the true structure-property relationship in these in situ generated catalysts, we use multimodel operando characterizations including Raman spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray reflectivity to investigate the restructuring of a representative catalyst, Co9S8, that shows better activity compared to the commercial standard RuO2during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a key half reaction in water-splitting for hydrogen generation. We find that Co9S8ultimately converts to oxide cluster (CoOx) containing six oxygen coordinated Co octahedra as the basic unit which is the true catalytic center to promote high OER activity. The density functional theory calculations verify the in situ generated CoOxconsisting of edge-sharing CoO6octahedral clusters as the actual active sites. Our results also provide insights to design other transition-metal-based materials as efficient electrocatalysts that experience a similar restructuring in OER."

While the essential target of research in single-atom catalysis is the precise synthesis of stable single-atom catalysts (SACs) with clear configurations and impressive catalytic performance, theoretical investigations have also played important roles in identifying active sites, revealing catalytic mechanisms, and establishing structure-activity relationships. Nevertheless, special attention should still be paid in theoretical works to the particularity of SACs. In this Perspective, we will summarize the theoretical progress made on the understanding of the rich phenomena in single-atom catalysis. We focus on the determination of local structures of SACs via comparison between experiments and simulations, the discovery of distinctive catalytic mechanisms induced by multiadsorption, synergetic effects, and dynamic evolutions, to name a few, the proposal of criteria for theoretically designing SACs, and the extension of original concepts of single-atom catalysis. We hope that this Perspective will inspire more in-depth thinking on future theoretical studies of SACs."

All rights reserved.Compositionally versatile, nonstoichiometric, mixed ionic-electronic conducting metal oxides of the form An+1BnO3n+1(n = 1 → ∞ A = rare-earth-/alkaline-earth-metal cation; B = transition-metal (TM) cation) remain a highly attractive class of electrocatalysts for catalyzing the energy-intensive oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The current design strategies for describing their OER activities are largely derived assuming a static, unchanged view of their surfaces, despite reports of dynamic structural changes to 3d TM-based perovskites during OER. Herein, through variations in the A- and B-site compositions of An+1BnO3n+1oxides (n = 1 (A2BO4) or n = ∞ (ABO3); A = La, Sr, Ca; B = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni), we show that, in the absence of electrolyte impurities, surface restructuring is universally the source of high OER activity in these oxides and is dependent on the initial oxide composition. Oxide surface restructuring is induced by irreversible A-site cation dissolution, resulting in in situ formation of a TM oxyhydroxide shell on top of the parent oxide core that serves as the active surface for OER. The rate of surface restructuring is found to depend on (i) composition of A-site cations, with alkaline-earth-metal cations dominating lanthanide cation dissolution, (ii) oxide crystal phase, with n = 1 A2BO4oxides exhibiting higher rates of A-site dissolution in comparison to n = ∞ ABO3perovskites, (iii) lattice strain in the oxide induced by mixed rare-earth- and alkaline-earth-metal cations in the A-site, and (iv) oxide reducibility. Among the in situ generated 3d TM oxyhydroxide structures from An+1BnO3n+1oxides, Co-based structures are characterized by superior OER activity and stability, even in comparison to as-synthesized Co-oxyhydroxide, pointing to the generation of high active surface area structures through oxide restructuring. These insights are critical toward the development of revised design criteria to include surface dynamics for effectively describing the OER activity of nonstoichiometric mixed-metal oxides."

Published by American Chemical Society.Sustainable water oxidation requires low-cost, stable, and efficient redox couples, photosensitizers, and catalysts. Here, we introduce the in situ self-assembly of metal-atom-free organic-based semiconductive structures on the surface of carbon supports. The resulting TTF/TTF•+@carbon junction (TTF = tetrathiafulvalene) acts as an all-in-one highly stable redox-shuttle/photosensitizer/molecular-catalyst triad for the visible-light-driven water oxidation reaction (WOR) at neutral pH, eliminating the need for metallic or organometallic catalysts and sacrificial electron acceptors. A water/butyronitrile emulsion was used to physically separate the photoproducts of the WOR, H+ and TTF, allowing the extraction and subsequent reduction of protons in water, and the in situ electrochemical oxidation of TTF to TTF•+ on carbon in butyronitrile by constant anode potential electrolysis. During 100 h, no decomposition of TTF was observed and O2 was generated from the emulsion while H2 was constantly produced in the aqueous phase. This work opens new perspectives for a new generation of metal-atom-free, low-cost, redox-driven water-splitting strategies."

Published by American Chemical Society.The economic viability and systemic sustainability of a green hydrogen economy are primarily dependent on its storage. However, none of the current hydrogen storage methods meet all the targets set by the US Department of Energy (DoE) for mobile hydrogen storage. One of the most promising routes is through the chemical reaction of alkali metals with water; however, this method has not received much attention owing to its irreversible nature. Herein, we present a reconditioned seawater battery-assisted hydrogen storage system that can provide a solution to the irreversible nature of alkali-metal-based hydrogen storage. We show that this system can also be applied to relatively lighter alkali metals such as lithium as well as sodium, which increases the possibility of fulfilling the DoE target. Furthermore, we found that small (1.75 cm2) and scaled-up (70 cm2) systems showed high Faradaic efficiencies of over 94%, even in the presence of oxygen, which enhances their viability."

This study reports the electrodeposition and characterization of a transition-metal (Mo, Fe)-codoped nickel phosphide (Ni3P:FeMo) bifunctional catalyst for enhanced overall water splitting in an alkaline medium. The Ni3P:FeMo catalyst exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic performance for both the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction with low overpotentials of -103 and 290 mV, respectively, at a high current density of 100 mA/cm2 along with fast electrocatalytic kinetics. A full water-splitting electrolyzer consisting of a bifunctional Ni3P:FeMo catalyst required a low cell voltage of 1.48 V to attain a current density of 10 mA/cm2 with excellent stability for more than 50 h. Density functional theory calculations provided insights into the microscopic mechanism of the effective modulation of the p- and d-band centers of the P and Ni active sites by the Mo and Fe codoping of Ni3P, thereby enhancing the bifunctional catalytic activity of Ni3P."

All rights reserved.A fast and facile pulse combustion (PC) method that allows for the continuous production of multigram quantities of high-metal-loaded and highly uniform supported metallic nanoparticles (SMNPs) is presented. Namely, various metal on carbon (M/C) composites have been prepared by using only three feedstock components: water, metal-salt, and the supporting material. The present approach can be elegantly utilized also for numerous other applications in electrocatalysis, heterogeneous catalysis, and sensors. In this study, the PC-prepared M/C composites were used as metal precursors for the Pt NPs deposition using double passivation with the galvanic displacement method (DP method). Lastly, by using thin-film rotating disc electrode (TF-RDE) and gas-diffusion electrode (GDE) methodologies, we show that the synergistic effects of combining PC technology with the DP method enable production of superior intermetallic Pt-M electrocatalysts with an improved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance when compared to a commercial Pt-Co electrocatalyst for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) application."

Therefore, it is vital to develop a reliable methodology for the accurate and precise real-time sensing of carcinogenic FT in water samples at trace concentration to ensure environmental safety. We aim to fabricate the low-cost VS2-attached reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets via a simple hydrothermal approach. It was further applied for the rapid and accurate sensing of toxic FT. The VS2/RGO-composite delivers a more favorable microenvironment for the rapid electrocatalytic sensing performance towards toxic FT reduction than the VS2 and RGO modified electrodes. The electron transfer rate constant (ks) and the saturating absorption capacity (Γ) value of FT was evaluated to be 1.52 s−1 and 2.18 × 10−10 mol cm−2, respectively. The constructed sensor exhibits a wide linear relationship after amperometry between the cathodic current densities and the concentrations of FT in the range of 5–90 nM and high sensitivity (5.569 μA nM−1 cm−2); moreover, the detection limit was 0.07 nM (S/N = 3).

However, the powdered MOFs are always suffered from aggregation during use and difficult collection after use. These problems discount their efficiency and inhibit their reusability. In this work, Zr-based MOF (UiO-66) was successfully imprisoned into a water-stable polyacrylonitrile (PAN) substrate by electrospinning. The containing UiO-66 hybrid membrane was confirmed by instrumental characterizations and its stability was also investigated by ICP-OES analysis. The obtained composite membrane can efficiently remove both arsenite (AsIII) and arsenate (AsV) from water under natural pH conditions. The adsorption kinetic fitted well with pseudo-second-order model and was dominated by chemisorption. Its adsorption isotherm can be described by Langmuir model. The maximal adsorption capacities of the hybrid membrane for As(V) and As(III) were 42.17 mg/g and 32.90 mg/g, respectively. Our results demonstrated that the MOFs-dispersed electrospun nanofiber membrane can greatly inherit the MOFs’ original adsorption properties and exhibits good regenerability without loss of MOFs. Electrospinning is an effective and practical method for the preparation of MOFs hybrid membrane, which makes the composite very easy to be collected after use."

This work deals with studying the role of cellulose- and carbon-based nanoparticles on liquid crystal performance of modified hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) in lyotropic suspension and nanocomposite films in a comparison study. The lyotropic suspension of HPC and HPC-nanocomposites were characterized by rheological study and optical properties. The Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray Diffractometry (XRD), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), mechanical analysis, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and optical properties were the techniques used to characterize the nanocomposite films. The results showed that, introducing the cellulose and carbon nanoparticles lowered the critical concentration of lyotropic suspension of HPC from 30 wt.% to 26–28 wt.% and earlier appearance of anisotropic phases was occurred which evidenced by the rheological curves and optical properties. The FTIR, XRD and TGA of nanocomposite films showed no change in backbone chemical structure of HPC but the incorporation of nanoparticles, especially cellulose-based NPs, enhanced the crystallinity, thermal stability behaviour and mechanical properties. The behaviour of carbon-NPs in HPC film was unaccepted, where it deteriorated the mechanical properties. The nanocomposite films displayed good fingerprint texture (especially with cellulose nanocrystals) with moderated defined morphologies that promote the liquid crystal nanocomposite development."

We have studied electrochemical stability of a commercial Pd/C sample in an acidic electrolyte by exposing it to an accelerated stress test (AST) to mimic potential spikes in fuel cells and electrolyzers during start/stop events. AST consisted of extensive rapid potential cycling (5000 cycles, 1 V/s) in two potential regions, namely AST1 was performed between 0.4 and 1.4 VRHE, while AST2 was performed between 0.05 and 1.4 VRHE. Degradation of Pd/C was monitored by the changes in Pd electrochemical surface area, while the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was used as a test reaction to observe the corresponding impact of the degradation on the activity of Pd/C. Significant Pd/C degradation and HER activity loss were observed in both potential regions. Coupling of the electrochemical flow cell with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry device showed substantial Pd dissolution during both ASTs. Identical location scanning electron microscopy revealed that Pd dissolution is followed by redeposition during both ASTs, resulting in particle size growth. Particle size growth was seen as especially dramatic in the case of AST2, when particularly large Pd nanostructures were obtained on top of the catalyst layer. According to the results presented in this work, (in)stability of Pd/C and other Pd-based nanocatalysts should be studied systematically as it may present a key factor limiting their application in energy conversion devices."

Published by American Chemical Society.Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule that is involved in a wide range of physiological and pathological events in biology. Metal coordination chemistry, especially with iron, is at the heart of many biological transformations involving NO. A series of heme proteins, nitric oxide synthases (NOS), soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), and nitrophorins, are responsible for the biosynthesis, sensing, and transport of NO. Alternatively, NO can be generated from nitrite by heme- and copper-containing nitrite reductases (NIRs). The NO-bearing small molecules such as nitrosothiols and dinitrosyl iron complexes (DNICs) can serve as an alternative vehicle for NO storage and transport. Once NO is formed, the rich reaction chemistry of NO leads to a wide variety of biological activities including reduction of NO by heme or non-heme iron-containing NO reductases and protein post-translational modifications by DNICs. Much of our understanding of the reactivity of metal sites in biology with NO and the mechanisms of these transformations has come from the elucidation of the geometric and electronic structures and chemical reactivity of synthetic model systems, in synergy with biochemical and biophysical studies on the relevant proteins themselves. This review focuses on recent advancements from studies on proteins and model complexes that not only have improved our understanding of the biological roles of NO but also have provided foundations for biomedical research and for bio-inspired catalyst design in energy science."

However, their practical applications have been plagued by rapid capacity decay, which is mainly ascribed to issues with the design and balance of components inside the batteries. In recent years, many advanced components have been reported, but few have been applied in practical Li-S batteries. Inspired by the wooden-barrel effect, in this perspective, we propose an optimized combination that integrates all advanced components into one system. For a better understanding of this topic, the typically advanced designs applied in Li-S pouch cells are summarized. Subsequently, the safety performance of Li-S pouch cells under extreme testing conditions are provided. Finally, our personal insights for the future development direction of Li-S pouch cells are proposed."

Metal-air battery (MAB) is a potential energy storage technology with high theoretical energy density and safety. However, the conventional air cathode material synthesized from carbon nanotube (CNT) is rather costly. In this study, several biomass wastes such as oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB), garlic peel (GP) and oil palm frond (OPF) were investigated to identify a suitable greener and efficient precursor to syntheelesize carbon nanoparticle as air electrode material for MAB. The carbon materials were synthesized through carbonization of precursor at different temperatures of 450 °C, 600 °C, and 700 °C before activation with potassium hydroxide (KOH) through wet impregnation method. The materials synthesized were evaluated based on its chemical and physical properties through characterization using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersion x-ray (SEM-EDX), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) analysis. Based on the experiments conducted, it was found that the suitable precursor was the OPF as it displayed a better tunability for enhanced electrical conductivity as it was able to achieve smaller sized particles with higher specific surface area of 548.26 m2/g and hierarchical porous structure at 700 °C compared to OPEFB and GP.

The thermal property and flame retardancy of CNSs/PET composites were thoroughly investigated. Results showed that CNSs displayed good flame-retardant performance for PET. When blended with only 1.0 wt.% of CNSs, CNSs/PET exhibited a limiting oxygen index (LOI) of 26.3 and a vertical combustion class of V-2, and its peak-heat release rate (pk-HRR) was reduced by 41.6%. Importantly, the initial decomposition temperature and the maximum weight loss temperature of CNSs/PET were 52°C and 199°C higher than those of PET, respectively. Furthermore, a condensed phase flame-retardant mechanism appeared in CNSs/PET, which formed a dense and thermally stable protective char layer during combustion.

Here, we use ab initio molecular dynamics to examine the proton-transfer/diffusion and redox behavior in a water layer confined in the graphene-Ti3C2O2 heterostructure. We find that in comparison with the similar interface of water confined between Ti3C2O2 layers, the proton redox rate in the dissimilar interface of graphene-Ti3C2O2 is much higher, owing to the very different interfacial structure as well as the interfacial electric field induced by an electron transfer in the latter. Water molecules in the dissimilar interface of the graphene-Ti3C2O2 heterostructure form a denser hydrogen-bond network with a preferred orientation of water molecules, leading to an increase in proton mobility with proton concentration in the graphene-Ti3C2O2 interface. As the proton concentration further increases, proton mobility decreases due to increasingly more frequent surface redox events that slow down proton mobility due to binding with surface O atoms. Our work provides important insights into how the dissimilar interface and their associated interfacial structure and properties impact proton transfer and redox in the confined space."

Although alkaline conditions extend the scope of electrocatalysts beyond precious metal-based materials to earth-abundant materials, the sluggish kinetics of cathodic and anodic reactions (hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively) impede the development of practical electrocatalysts that do not use precious metals. This review discusses the rational design of efficient electrocatalysts by exploiting the understanding of alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction mechanisms and of the electron structure-activity relationship, as achieved by combining experimental and computational approaches. The enhancement of water splitting not only deals with intrinsic catalytic activity but also includes the aspect of electrical conductivity and stability.

However, the existing fabrication strategies typically involve low-yield and multistep processes leading to the formation of powders that necessitate binding agents when used for electrochemical applications; thereby, the durability and performance of the resultant electrode may be adversely impacted. To address these challenges, the present work first reports a high-temperature counter-current gas flow technique for rapid fabrication (5-10 min) of centimetre-size, self-adhesive, free-standing 3D patches made of ZnO-based woven nanowires. Furthermore, the high applicability of the method was shown by layer-by-layer assembly of the ZnO and layers of 0D heteroatoms including Bi2O3, CdO, SnO2, and carbon forming stratified oxide heterojunction (SOH) nanostructures with midgap states within their electronic bandgap region. This work is innovative in that the ZnO and the fabricated SOHs are synthesised through a sustainable and large-scale method based on microrecycling of waste materials. The engineering of the electronic band positions can modify the functionality of the SOH patches by optimising the potentials required for catalytic reactions. As a representative, the SOH nanostructures were tested for anodic electrocatalytic water oxidation to H2O2. The results showed that the ZnO-CdO patch has the lowest overpotential of 150 mV and outstanding stability at 2.33 V vs. RHE. Furthermore, the results of first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations (i) confirmed realignments of the band position due to the formation of midgap states, and (ii) revealed that significant improvements in the electrocatalytic H2O2 performance can be achieved with overpotentials as low as 0.19 and 0.31 V for ZnO-CdO and ZnO-Bi2O3, respectively. This work offers an ultrafast fabrication strategy to synthesise binder-free SOH nanostructures with an engineered electronic structure that can be an alternative to state-of-the-art noble metal electrocatalysts such as Pt."

The Commission Internationale del'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates are located at (0.21, 0.23) and the device lifetime with 65% brightness (T65) reaches over 217 h because of the chemically inert surface of the CDs. The results mean the devices are the most stable CDs-LEDs reported to date.

Different variables are known to affect the performance of GDEs. Especially regarding the catalyst loading, there are diverging trends reported in terms of activity and selectivity, e.g. for CO2 reduction to CO. We have used shear-force based Au nanoelectrode positioning and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) in the surface-generation tip collection mode to evaluate the activity of Au GDEs for CO2 reduction as a function of catalyst loading and CO2 back pressure. Using a Au nanoelectrode, we have locally measured the amount of CO produced along a catalyst loading gradient under operando conditions. We observed that an optimum local loading of catalyst is necessary to achieve high activities. However, this optimum is directly dependent on the CO2 back pressure. Our work does not only present a tool to evaluate the activity of GDEs locally, it also allows drawing a more precise picture regarding the effect of catalyst loading and CO2 back pressure on their performance."

Published by American Chemical SocietyFor efficient electrocatalytic water-splitting, developing a nonprecious-metal-based stable and highly active material is the most challenging task. In this paper, we have devised a synthesis strategy for a hybrid catalyst composed of molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) and a Zr-based metal–organic framework (MOF) (UiO-66) via the solvothermal process. Synergistic effects between Mo2C and UiO-66 lead to a decrease in the hydrogen adsorption energy on the catalysts, and Mo2C/UiO-66 hybrids offer excellent catalytic activity in an alkaline environment for water-splitting. Particularly, the optimized Mo2C/UiO-66 hybrid, termed MCU-2 with 50:50 wt % of both components, displayed the best catalytic performance for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER). It offered a small overpotential of 174.1 mV to attain a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel plot value of 147 mV/dec for HER. It also offered a low overpotential of around 180 mV to attain a current density of 20 mA/cm2 and a Tafel plot value of 134 mV/dec for OER. Additionally, the catalyst was stable for over 24 h and ∼1000 cycles with a very minute shift in performance, and the electrolyzer indicates that a potential of ∼1.3 V is required to reach 10 mA/cm2 current density. It can be inferred from the results that the Mo2C/UiO-66 hybrid is a promising candidate as a nonexpensive and active catalyst for overall electrocatalytic water-splitting as the devised catalyst exhibits enhanced kinetics for both OER and HER, a more exposed surface area, faster electron transport, and enhanced diffusion of the electrolyte."

This concept can be realized by coupling different CO2R catalysts to different subcells in a multijunction photovoltaic (PV) stack. Efficient implementation will require careful tuning of the photocurrents and design of the photovoltages provided by the subcells to the CO2R catalysts in such a way as to facilitate the target reaction. Here, we outline the design principles of the tandem PEC approach using two-step conversion of CO2 to ethylene in aqueous electrolyte, via a CO intermediate, as a model system. To perform this reaction, the first coupled PV-catalyst component should provide 4 electrons to reduce 2 molecules of CO2 to CO; the second component should provide 8 electrons to reduce 2 CO molecules to C2H4. Based on known CO2R catalysts, the overpotential required to produce CO can be less than that required to reduce it to ethylene, creating the opportunity for improved efficiency. Cascade PEC can be realized in a three-terminal tandem (3TT) configuration using III-V-semiconductor based subcells coupled to Au (produces CO intermediate) and Cu (converts CO to ethylene). The current to each catalyst can be controlled by the area of the subcell exposed to the electrolyte, and the photovoltage is determined by the materials selected and device configuration. Operating conditions are found by simulating the coupled system using the open-source circuit simulator SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuits Emphasis). We identify conditions under which a 3TT configuration can have a higher solar to chemical conversion efficiency compared to a two-terminal two-junction tandem (2T 2J) with the same absorbers and a Cu catalyst only. We also show that 3TT PEC devices can be less sensitive to variations in catalyst activity compared to 2T devices. Finally, we discuss the applications of cascade PEC to CO2 reduction, using different intermediates, and to other chemical networks."

Here we report that a highly porous carbon nanotube (CNT) cathode dramatically enhances the rate capability of LAB. Single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) with wavy patterns prepared from the Super-Growth (SG) method successfully provided CNT sheets with high porosity of up to 94%. The pore structure was characterized by two distinct pores in size, namely, highly extended mesoscale (approximately 5–200 nm) pores formed inside CNT bundles that provide large surface area for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and inter-bundle gaps in a micrometer scale that works for oxygen diffusion path. This porous CNT sheet cathode significantly increased the discharge rate of LAB cells, specifically enabling a high discharge current density of 3.0 mA/cm2 securing practical cell capacity of 3.3 mAh/cm2, which is comparable to the current LiB technology that provides ∼3 mAh/cm2 cell capacity at ∼1C rate (∼3 mA/cm2) discharge. Furthermore, this highly porous cathode was also effective for extending the cycle life of LAB cells. Such bimodal pore architecture of the CNT sheet cathode paves the new strategy for developing high-power energy-dense LAB."

Herein, we address this question for a two-step electrocatalytic reaction. With the transfer coefficient assumed as 1/2, our analysis reveals that the adsorbate coverage at the volcano apex equals 1/2 regardless of potential. We present a criterion to predict the direction and magnitude of the apex shift as a function of the activation energies of the two steps. Thereafter, the criterion is extended to the oxygen reduction reaction. The influence of the transfer coefficient and the potential of zero charge on the volcano plot is revealed.

However, basic properties of hydrogenated titanium monoxides have not been investigated so far. In the present work, we report the results of the first studies of the crystal structure, vibrational spectra, and mobility of H atoms in TiO0.72H0.30 and TiO0.96H0.14 using X-ray diffraction (XRD), neutron powder diffraction, neutron vibrational spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The hydrogenated compound TiO0.72H0.30 is found to retain the disordered cubic B1-type structure of the initial titanium monoxide, where H atoms exclusively occupy vacancies in the oxygen sublattice. It has been revealed that hydrogenation of the disordered cubic TiO0.96 leads to the formation of the two-phase compound TiO0.96H0.14, where the disordered B1-type phase coexists with the monoclinic phase of Ti5O5 type with an ordered arrangement of vacancies. In both phases, H atoms are found to occupy only vacancies in the oxygen sublattice. The low-temperature inelastic neutron scattering spectra of TiO0.72H0.30 and TiO0.96H0.14 in the energy transfer range of 40–180 meV exhibit a single peak due to optical oxygen vibrations (centered on about 60 meV) and a broad structure at 90–170 meV due to optical H vibrations. The unusual width of this structure can be attributed to the broken symmetry of hydrogen sites in the titanium monoxides: because of the presence of vacancies in the titanium sublattice, the actual point symmetry of these sites appears to be lower than octahedral. Proton NMR measurements have revealed that both hydrogenated compounds are metallic; no signs of hydrogen diffusive motion in TiO0.72H0.30 and TiO0.96H0.14 at the frequency scale of about 105 s-1 have been found up to 370 K."

This work follows a strategy based on independent tuning of ligands in the primary coordination sphere to discover a previously unreported iron catalyst for CO2 reduction with higher activity than similar complexes while maintaining the same overpotential. Iron complexes bearing a bis-N-heterocyclic carbene ligand (methylenebis(N-methylimidazol-2-ylidene), bis-mim) and a redox active 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine (tpy) ligand were synthesized and found to catalyze the selective reduction of CO2 to CO at low overpotential with water as the proton source.

The cobalt complexes 1 and 2 were supported on ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) by π–π stacking, resulting in heterogenized cobalt materials 6-FP-Co-OMC-1 and 5-FP-Co-OMC-2, respectively, and studied for electrocatalytic water oxidation. We find that 6-FP-Co-OMC-1 exhibits an overpotential of 355 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm–2 and a turnover frequency (TOF) of ∼0.53 s–1 at an overpotential of 400 mV at pH 14. 6-FP-Co-OMC-1 exhibits activity that is ∼1.6 times that of 5-FP-Co-OMC-2, which gives a TOF of 0.32 s–1 at 400 mV overpotential. The structural stability of the single-atom Co site was demonstrated for 6-FP-Co-OMC-1 using X-ray absorption spectroscopy for the molecular complex supported on OMC, but slow degradation in catalyst activity can be attributed to eventual formation of Co oxide clusters. DFT computations of electrocatalytic water oxidation using the molecular complexes as models provide a description of the catalytic mechanism. These studies reveal that the mechanism for O–O bond formation involves an intermediate CoIV oxo complex that undergoes an intramolecular reductive O–O coupling to form a CoII–OOH species. Further, the calculations predict that the molecular 6-FP-Co structure is more active for electrocatalytic water oxidation than 5-FP-Co, which is consistent with experimental studies of 6-FP-Co-OMC-1 and 5-FP-Co-OMC-2, highlighting the possibility that the ligand structure influences the catalytic activity of the supported molecular catalysts."

In this study, we employ time-resolved operando spectroelectrochemistry to investigate the redox-state kinetics of IrOx electrocatalyst films for both water and hydrogen peroxide oxidation. Three different redox species involving Ir3+, Ir3.x+, Ir4+, and Ir4.y+ are identified spectroscopically, and their concentrations are quantified as a function of applied potential. The generation of Ir4.y+ states is found to be the potential-determining step for catalytic water oxidation, while H2O2 oxidation is observed to be driven by the generation of Ir4+ states. The reaction kinetics for water oxidation, determined from the optical signal decays at open circuit, accelerates from ∼20 to <0.5 s with increasing applied potential above 1.3 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode [i.e., turnover frequencies (TOFs) per active Ir state increasing from 0.05 to 2 s–1]. In contrast, the reaction kinetics for H2O2 is found to be almost independent of the applied potential (increasing from 0.1 to 0.3 s–1 over a wider potential window), indicative of a first-order reaction mechanism. These spectroelectrochemical data quantify the increase of both the density of active Ir4.y+ states and the TOFs of these states with applied positive potential, resulting in the observed sharp turn on of catalytic water oxidation current. We reconcile these data with the broader literature while providing a unique kinetic insight into IrOx electrocatalytic reaction mechanisms, indicating a first-order reaction mechanism for H2O2 oxidation driven by Ir4+ states and a higher-order reaction mechanism involving the cooperative interaction of multiple Ir4.y+ states for water oxidation."

Published by American Chemical Society.A family of iron-doped manganese-related hollandites, KxMn1–yFeyO2−δ (0 ≤ y ≤ 0.15), with high performance in CO oxidation have been prepared. Among them, the most active catalyst, K0.11Mn0.876Fe0.123O1.80(OH)0.09, is able to oxidize more than 50% of CO at room temperature. Detailed compositional and structural characterization studies, using a wide battery of thermogravimetric, spectroscopic, and diffractometric techniques, both at macroscopic and microscopic levels, have provided essential information about this never-reported behavior, which relates to the oxidation state of manganese. Neutron diffraction studies evidence that the above compound stabilizes hydroxyl groups at the midpoints of the tunnel edges as in isostructural β-FeOOH. The presence of oxygen and hydroxyl species at the anion sublattice and Mn3+, confirmed by electron energy loss spectroscopy, appears to play a key role in the catalytic activity of this doped hollandite oxide. The analysis of these detailed structural features has allowed us to point out the key role of both OH groups and Mn3+ content in these materials, which are able to effectively transform CO without involving any critical, noble metal in the catalyst formulation."

Herein, we developed an efficient cobalt–vanadium spinel-type electrocatalyst with an extremely high concentration of Co3+ ions by tuning the balanced vanadium ions’ concentration in crystallinity-modulated Co2–xVxO4 nanoplates. This resulted in the lowest overpotential of 240 mV at 10 mA/cm2, the smallest Tafel slope of 45 mV dec–1, and a current density of 100 mA/cm2 at an overpotential of 280 mV for water oxidation, which is remarkably 20 times better than that of the benchmark RuO2 catalyst, along with excellent stability. Such excellent performance is due to the very high Co3+/Co2+ ratio of 2.84 achieved in situ in the low-crystallinity Co2–xVxO4 (LC-Co2–xVxO4) sample, which is 40% higher than that of the widely reported Co3O4, as evidenced by both operando X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy and in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These findings stimulate the opportunities to explore Co2–xVxO4 as a class of nonprecious-metal-based efficient OER electrocatalysts."

Considering the complexity of designing catalyst, we demonstrate a data-driven strategy to develop optimized catalysts for H2 evolution. This work starts by collecting data of Pt/carbon catalysts, and applying machine learning to reveal the importance of ranking various features. The algorithms reveal that the Pt content and Pt size have the greatest impact on the catalyst overpotentials. Following the data-driven analysis, a space-confined method is used to fabricate the size-controllable Pt nanoclusters that anchor on nitrogen-doped (N-doped) mesoporous carbon nanosheet network.

However, molten-salt etching results in MXene clays that are not water dispersible, thus preventing further processing. This occurs because molten-salt etching results in a lack of -OH terminal groups rendering the MXene clay hydrophobic. Here, we demonstrate a method that produces water-dispersible Ti3C2Tz nanosheets using molten salt (SnF2) to etch. In molten salt etching, SnF2 diffuses between the layers to form AlF3 and Sn as byproducts, separating the layers. The stable, aqueous Ti3C2Tz dispersion yields a ζ potential of −31.7 mV, because of -OH terminal groups introduced by KOH washing. X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy confirm the formation of Ti3C2Tz etched clay with substantial d-spacing as compared with clay etched with HF. This work is the first to use molten salt etching to successfully prepare colloidally stable aqueous dispersions of Ti3C2Tz nanosheets."

However, the commonly required high-temperature pyrolysis usually results in undesirable structural changes and randomly produced active sites which gives rise to great challenges to the structure-property relationships, inevitably hindering the understanding of the reaction mechanisms. Herein, we demonstrate a simple yet robust pyrolysis-free route to craft single-atom cobalt catalysts with high electrocatalytic ORR activity via judiciously in situ wrapping an electrocatalytically active porphyrin-based thiophene-sulfur site-containing covalent organic polymer (PTS-COP) shell around a highly conductive multiwalled CNT (MWCNT) core, followed by accurately anchoring single-atom Co-N4 sites onto the macrocyclic porphyrin structure. The resulting Co-PTS-COPs@MWCNTs was exploited as an ORR electrocatalyst and displayed outstanding performance as a direct consequence of the advantageous architecture (i.e., 1D core@shell heterostructures with few-layer-thick PTS-COP shells) and unique active site configurations (i.e., atomically anchored Co-N4 sites and homogeneously dispersed thiophene-sulfur sites). Remarkably, an alkaline electrolyte capitalizing on Co-PTS-COPs@MWCNTs achieved excellent ORR activity (Eonset, 0.930 V; E1/2, 0.835 V), and favourable long-term durability, comparable to that of state-of-the-art carbon-based electrocatalysts."

Besides, the harsh reaction conditions of electrocatalysis also challenged the catalytic stability of SACs. The excellent electrocatalytic performance of SACs always degrades under long-term operating conditions. Most previous studies of SACs have focused more on the activity and selectivity of SACs in electrocatalysis, while catalytic stability has received little attention as a more critical factor limiting their large-scale industrial application. In this review, we provide an overview of the recent advances in SACs in terms of selecting the metal and support materials, synthetic strategies, and electrocatalytic applications with a focus on catalytic stability. A deep understanding of the instability behaviors of SACs under different electrocatalytic conditions contributes to the design of effective synthetic strategies to further optimize their catalytic stability, which is particularly discussed.

In this article, an innovative and facile method of crystal reorganization was designed by using MOFs as sacrificial templates to prepare a layered double hydroxide (LDH) nano-layer sheet structure through a pseudomorphic conversion process under alkaline conditions. The obtained CoMn-LDH and CoFe-LDH catalysts broke the ligand of MOFs and reorganized the structure on the basis of retaining a high specific surface area and a large number of pores, which had higher specific surface area and well developed pore structure compared with LDH catalysts prepared by traditional methods, and thus provide more active sites to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS). Due to the unique framework structure of MOFs, the MOF-derived CoMn-LDH and CoFe-LDH catalysts could provide more active sites to activate PMS, and achieve a 2,4-dichlorophenol degradation of 99.3% and 99.2% within 20 minutes, respectively. In addition the two LDH catalysts displayed excellent degradation performance for bisphenol A, ciprofloxacin and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated that the valence state transformation of metal elements participated in PMS activation. Electron paramagnetic resonance manifested that sulfate radical (SO†4 - ) and singlet oxygen (1O2) were the main species for degrading pollutants. In addition, after the three-cycle experiment, the CoMn-LDH and CoFe-LDH catalysts also showed long-term stability with a slight activity decrease in the third cycle. The phytotoxicity assessment determined by the germination of mung beans proved that PMS activation by MOF-derived LDH catalysts can basically eliminate the phytotoxicity of a 2,4-D solution. This research not only developed high-activity LDH catalysts for PMS activation, but also expanded the environmental applications of MOF derivants."

Recently, PtNPs gathered growing interest as delivery vectors for drugs, biosensors and as surface coating on chronically implanted biomedical devices for improving electrochemical properties. However, there are contradictory statements about their biocompatibility and impact on target organs such as the brain tissue, where these NPs are finding many applications. Furthermore, many of the reported studies are conducted in homeostasis conditions and, consequently, neglect the impact of the pathologic conditions on the tissue response. To expand our knowledge on the effects of PtNPs on neuronal and glial cells, we investigated the acute effects of monodisperse sodium citrate-coated PtNPs on rat organotypic hippocampal cultures in physiological or neuronal excitotoxic conditions induced by kainic acid (KA). The cellular responses of the PtNPs were evaluated through cytotoxic assays and confocal microscopy analysis. To mimic a pathologic scenario, 7-day organotypic hippocampal cultures were exposed to KA for 24 h. Subsequently, PtNPs were added to each slice. We show that incubation of the slices with PtNPs for 24 h, does not severely impact cell viability in normal conditions, with no significant differences when comparing the dentate gyrus (DG), as well as CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cell layers. Such effects are not exacerbated in KA-treated slices, where the presence of PtNPs does not cause additional neuronal propidium iodide (PI) uptake in CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cell layers. However, PtNPs cause microglial cell activation and morphological alterations in CA3 and DG regions indicating the establishment of an inflammatory reaction. Morphological analysis revealed that microglia acquire activated ameboid morphology with loss of ramifications, as a result of their response to PtNPs contact. Surprisingly, this effect is not increased in pathological conditions. Taken together, these results show that PtNPs cause microglia alterations in short-term studies. Additionally, there is no worsening of the tissue response in a neuropathological induced scenario. This work highlights the need of further research to allow for the safe use of PtNPs. Also, it supports the demand of the development of novel and more biocompatible NPs to be applied in the brain."

Various methods have been developed to suppress the active sulfur loss, but the results are far from ideal. Herein, we propose a facile sulfur compensation strategy to improve the cyclic stability of Li-S batteries. The strategy is to compensate sulfur to the cathode by chemical reactions between additional sulfur and lithium polysulfides diffusing away from the cathode. The compensatory sulfur can effectively mitigate the loss of active sulfur in the cathode side caused by the shuttle effect and thus maintain the high capacity of the battery during charging and discharging for long life cycle assessments. Using this strategy, the specific capacity of the assembled Li-S batteries was maintained at >700 mA h g-1 for more than 500 cycles at 1 C and >1000 mA h g-1 for ∼100 cycles at 0.1 C, while the capacity of control batteries rapidly decreased to <200 mA h g-1 under the same conditions."

Carbon-based felts are commonly used as electrodes in such devices due to their high chemical stability in acid media, high electrical conductivity and their three-dimensional structure. However, they show low reversibility and electrocatalytic activity, especially for the VO2+ / VO2+ redox couple. In the quest for improving the electrochemical behaviour of carbon-based felts, it has been proposed to modify them with functionalized carbon nanotubes or graphene oxide by electrophoretic deposition. To elucidate if the improvements achieved on these electrodes can be really ascribed to the presence of the carbon nanomaterials or to the oxidation undergone by the fibers during this treatment, the electro-oxidation of a pristine rayon-based graphitized carbon felt was performed in parallel. The electro-oxidized felt exhibits the best behaviour, suggesting that the improved performance obtained for the electrodes modified with nanocarbons are mainly influenced by the oxidation of the fibers."

Recently developed materials are less susceptible to the alkaline degradation of the polymer backbone and quaternary ammonium groups. A remaining challenge is the mechanical stability in contact with hot water and dimensional stability when the temperature of the feed solution changes. One solution is to reinforce membranes with a porous support. Since support materials like PEEK or PTFE have a different swelling behavior than the matrix and no strong interactions with the matrix, voids can form, and gas crossover increases. In this work, we approach this issue by pore filling polybenzimidazole nanofiber mats with the bromomethylated precursor of mTPN, an ultra-stable AEM material. During drying, a covalent interaction between support (PBI amine groups) and matrix (-CH2Br) is established. After quaternization, the optimized PBI/mTPN-50.120 composite membrane still shows a high conductivity of 62 mS cm−1, but 37% reduced length swelling in comparison to the non-reinforced membrane. Tensile strength and Young's modulus increase 17% and 56% to 49 MPa and 680 MPa, respectively. In an electrolyser, a stable voltage of 1.98V at 0.25 A cm−2 was achieved, and no change in membrane resistance was observed over the test time of 200 h (50 °C, 1 M KOH, catalysts based on Ni/Fe and Mo)."

Bismuth molybdate with its special layered structure in orthorhombic phase and hollow sphere morphology performed as potential electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline medium. The activity can further be enhanced by promoting iron in the crystal structure. The strain as well as dislocation developed in the crystal structure of Bi2MoO6 upon iron incorporation are well-studied. The presence of optimum amount of iron and thereby creating oxygen vacancies have been found to be beneficial, though higher concentration turns out to be detrimental for the electrocatalytic performance. The optimum iron promoted Bi2MoO6 leads to achieve overpotential value of 286 mV at 10 mA cm−2 current density with Tafel slope of only 44 mV dec-1 for OER. The experimental results are well-supported by the density functional theory simulations, which demonstrate that iron incorporation lowers the energy barrier by promoting the adsorptions of OER intermediates, most distinctly the oxygen adsorption."

In this study we proposed, for the very first time, to perform the photooxidation of glycerol towards added-value products with homemade WO3 and commercial WO3/TiO2 (DTW5)). Their performance was compared with that of state-of-the-art TiO2-based photocatalysts (Anatase, Rutile, and P25). We found that, while TiO2 favours the total oxidation of glycerol, WO3-based materials exhibit an outstanding selectivity towards one of the most valuable oxidation products: glyceraldehyde. It was attributed to their enhanced acidity, which selectively activates C–O bonds in glycerol and facilitates the further desorption of glyceraldehyde to the liquid phase. This study establishes therefore a new starting point towards the development of advanced materials for an efficient valorization of glycerol."

Herein a unique hetero-nanostructured Ni/NiFe-layered double oxide (Ni/NiFe-LDO) on Ni foam (NF) has been successfully constructed through phase-transition and controlled in-situ reduction process. Because the two-dimensional (2D) morphology of NiFe-LDO nanosheets can stabilize uniform in-situ formed nano-Ni sites, the prepared Ni/NiFe-LDO on NF displays a high catalytic activity for HER in 1.0 M KOH solution, which requires an extremely low overpotential of 29 mV to afford a current density at 10 mA cm−2, achieves a Tafel slope of 82 mV dec-1 and maintains an excellent stability of electrolysis for at least 24 h. Detail characterizations reveal that the synergistic effect between nano-Ni and NiFe-LDO nanosheets contributes to the prominent HER activity. In NiFe-LDO, Fe2O3 facilitates the adsorption of H2O on the interface region of Ni-Fe2O3, which is beneficial for water activation, then NiO offers the active sites for hydroxyl adsorption (*OH), meanwhile nano-Ni sites are active to adsorb hydrogen intermediates (H*). All of the above accelerates the water dissociation in Volmer-step reaction."

Here, a magnetically recyclable hybrid originating from used warm paste (greater than92% yield) was developed using water washing to activate PMS for antibiotics degradation under hypersaline system. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements indicated that the hybrid is a sheet structure with active Fe sites uniformly dispersed on the surface. The hybrid displayed an excellent PMS activation capacity; it is superior to those of classical Fe3O4 and Co3O4, which could degrade the tetracycline (TC). However, under a high-salt (0.2 mol/L Na2SO4) or mixed salts condition, the hybrid exhibited TC degradation performance. Moreover, a detailed investigation of the impact on of TC removal indicated that the preferable conditions were pH = 6, temperature = 25 °C, catalyst = 0.3 g/L and PMS = 0.3 g/L. Systematic experiments uncovered the hybrid exhibiting superb catalysis universality and adaptability in three refractory organics, 5 natural polluted water matrices, and coexisting-ions system, as well as five times, recycle processes. The surface chemical analysis combined with quenching experiment and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) test confirmed the PMS activation mechanism and the reactive radicals contributed in order of 1O2 > •OH > SO4•−. Considering its performance, stability and applicability, the warm paste hybrid would be good for PMS activation toward high-salt environment remediation. Thus inducing a novel direction for solid waste treatment and mitigated resource scarcity."

Combined electrochemical measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations identified the Gibbs free energy for adsorption of the *HOCO intermediate (ΔG(*HOCO)) as a potential descriptor for CO2RR, which could be adjusted by using different TMC and TMN supports. As opposed to structural strain effects, the electronic modification was found to be the key controlling factor in the interactions between TMC/TMN and supported Ag/Au.

The single-atom platinum supported catalyst greatly improves the utilization of platinum, but the catalytic activity and selectivity are greatly affected by the platinum coordination environment, and the preparation of the material is difficult. Doping base metals to adjust the electronic structure of platinum is an effective strategy to improve catalyst performance. In this work, copper-platinum alloy nanoparticles were loaded on N-doped porous carbon via a targeted route guided by highly dispersed Cu atoms derived from MOF. The product C-ZIF-CuPt has high activity and high stability ORR, HER bifunctional catalytic performance, which is better than commercial Pt/C (20 wt%). The Pt activity in C-ZIF-CuPt is 4.4 times (ORR) and 6.7 times (HER) than Pt/C. Spectromicroscopic determinations unveiled that strong interactions between carbon carrier and the CuPt alloys contribute to the overall stabilities. DFT calculations show that Cu doping can increase the d-band center of Pt, reduce the ORR overpotential, and the activation energy barrier to water molecules, which is beneficial to ORR and HER catalysis. Under the same carrier conditions, the performance of sub-nano (single atoms, clusters) platinum-supported catalysts (C-ZIF-Cu-Pt) is inferior to C-ZIF-CuPt. This further shows that platinum alloying can effectively improve the performance of the catalyst."

Gr-COOH on a GCE was used as an adsorbent in adsorptive anodic stripping voltammetry (AdASV). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and AdASV were employed to characterize the surface morphology and electrochemical behavior of the Gr-COOH/GCE. The sensitivity of the Gr-COOH/GCE was 3, 7, and 10 times higher than those of a Gr/GCE, GCE-COOH and bare GCE, respectively. Several operational parameters, including the amount of Gr-COOH, preconcentration potential and preconcentration time, were optimized. Under optimum conditions, the peak current response linearly increased with the hydroquinone concentration in the range of 0.1-40.0 μmol l−1 (r = 0.999) with a high sensitivity of 19.86 μA (μmol l−1)−1 cm−2 and a limit of detection of 0.04 μmol l−1.

The main reason is the competitive C2 production resulting from a traditional sequential C-C coupling mechanism. As a result, most catalysts could not facilitate C3 products since the carbon chain growth from C2 to C3 competes with C2 desorption. In this work, we carried out Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations with implicit solvation effects on densely arrayed Cu nanopyramids (Cu-DANs). We demonstrate that the co-adsorption energy of three *CO intermediates (ΔG3*CO; from the CO2 or CO reactant) is a descriptor for C3 activity. An activity volcano plot was constructed based on this discovery, which can be used to predict the optimal range for ΔG3*CO adsorption strength. We demonstrate that by applying the single-atom alloy catalyst strategy, i.e. embedding Ag single metal onto Cu-DANs, we could successfully tune the ΔG3*CO strength toward the optimal range. In addition, the adsorbed *CO could form a long carbon chain on such a structure via a one-step concerted trimerization mechanism to form the key C3 reaction intermediate, avoiding the competitive C2 desorption pathway. Furthermore, Ag-doped Cu-DANs could effectively retain oxygen atoms in the hydroxyl group, which enabled a pathway towards direct electrosynthesis of a new C3 product (C3H8O2; 1,2-PDO) beyond the only available n-propanol. Our newly discovered concerted trimerization mechanism in combination with single-atom alloy catalysts paves the way for materials design toward more long-chain oxygenate generation."

Meanwhile, Mn@Na4SiMo12 has high CO2RR selectivity and good catalytic performance (UL = −0.48 V).

Here, we report the results of a room temperature molecular dynamics study based on neural network potentials, which allow us to access long time scale simulations while retaining ab initio accuracy. We find that the water/Pt(111) interface is characterized by a double layer composed of a primary, strongly bound adsorption layer with a coverage of ∼0.15 ML, which is coupled to a secondary, weakly bound adsorption layer with a coverage of ∼0.58 ML. By studying the order of the primary adsorption layer, we find that there is an effective repulsion between the adsorbed water molecules, which gives rise to a dynamically changing, semi-ordered interfacial structure, where the water molecules in the primary adsorption layer are distributed homogeneously across the interface, forming frequent hydrogen bonds to water molecules in the secondary adsorption layer. We further show that these conclusions are beyond the time scales accessible to ab initio molecular dynamics."

Published by American Chemical Society.Nitrate (NO3-) contamination is becoming a major concern due to the negative effects of an excessive NO3- presence in water which can have detrimental effects on human health. Sensitive, real-time, low-cost, and portable measurement systems able to detect extremely low concentrations of NO3- in water are thus becoming extremely important. In this work, we present a novel method to realize a low-cost and easy to fabricate amperometric sensor capable of detecting small concentrations of NO3- in real water samples. The novel fabrication technique combines printing of a silver (Ag) working electrode with subsequent modification of the electrode with electrodeposited copper (Cu) nanoclusters. The process was tuned in order to reach optimized sensor response, with a high catalytic activity toward electroreduction of NO3- (sensitivity: 19.578 μA/mM), as well as a low limit of detection (LOD: 0.207 nM or 0.012 μg/L) and a good dynamic linear concentration range (0.05 to 5 mM or 31 to 310 mg/L). The sensors were tested against possible interference analytes (NO2-, Cl-, SO42-, HCO3-, CH3COO-, Fe2+, Fe3+, Mn2+, Na+, and Cu2+) yielding only negligible effects [maximum standard deviation (SD) was 3.9 μA]. The proposed sensors were also used to detect NO3- in real samples, including tap and river water, through the standard addition method, and the results were compared with the outcomes of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Temperature stability (maximum SD 3.09 μA), stability over time (maximum SD 3.69 μA), reproducibility (maximum SD 3.20 μA), and repeatability (maximum two-time useable) of this sensor were also investigated."

However, the large surface area required for charge storage is an irreconcilable contradiction with the requirement of energy density. Therefore, a high energy density is a major challenge for supercapacitors. To solve the contradiction, Co3S4/CNTs/C with a bridged structure is designed, where CNTs generated in situ serve as a bridge to connect a porous carbon matrix and a Co3S4 nanoparticle, and Co3S4 nanoparticles are anchored on the topmost of CNTs. The porous carbon and Co3S4 are used for electrochemical double-layer capacitors and pseudocapacitors, respectively. This bridged structure can efficiently utilize the surface of Co3S4 nanoparticles to increase the overall energy storage capacity and provide more electrochemically active sites for charge storage and delivery. The materials show an energy density of 41.3 Wh kg-1 at 691.9 W kg-1 power density and a retaining energy density of 33.1 Wh kg-1 at a high power density of 3199.9 W kg-1 in an asymmetrical supercapacitor.

Methods for immobilizing enzymes on the electrodes, while maintaining full redox control are highlighted. A case study of combined XAS and electrochemistry applied to a [NiFe] hydrogenase is presented. By entrapping the [NiFe] hydrogenase in a redox polymer, relatively high protein concentrations can be achieved on the electrode surface, while maintaining redox control. Overall, it is demonstrated that the experiments are feasible, but require precise redox control over the majority of the absorber atoms and careful controls to discriminate between electrochemically-driven changes and beam damage. Opportunities for future applications are discussed."
